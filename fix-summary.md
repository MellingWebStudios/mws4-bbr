# Broken Links Fix Summary

## Date: June 8, 2025

## Issue Identified
The link checker was finding broken links with HTTP_308 redirects following patterns like:
- `/selly-park/selly-park`
- `/hall-green/hall-green` 
- `/birmingham/birmingham`
- `/acocks-green/acocks-green`

These URLs had duplicate location slugs, which were being redirected by the middleware to the correct format.

## Root Causes Found and Fixed

### 1. Service Page Component Parameter Mismatch
**File:** `/app/[location]/[service]/page.tsx` (line 383)
**Issue:** RelatedServices component was receiving `location.name` instead of `location.slug`
**Fix:** Changed `currentLocation={location.name}` to `currentLocation={location.slug}`

### 2. Display Text vs URL Slug Confusion in Contextual Links
**File:** `/components/contextual-links.tsx` (line 215)
**Issue:** Component was using location slug in display text instead of location name
**Fix:** Added proper data lookup to use location name for display while using slug for URLs

### 3. Display Text Issues in Internal Links
**File:** `/components/internal-links.tsx` (lines 91, 153)
**Issue:** Components were showing slugs in user-facing text instead of proper names
**Fix:** Added proper data lookups to separate display names from URL slugs

### 4. Schema Markup URL Generation
**File:** `/components/schema-markup-location-minimal.tsx` (line 23)
**File:** `/components/schema-markup-location.tsx` (lines 27, 73, 76, 95)
**Issue:** Schema markup was manually converting `location.name` to slug format instead of using proper `location.slug`
**Fix:** Updated interface to include `slug` property and use `location.slug` for all URL generation

## Verification Results

### Build Status
✅ Application builds successfully with no compilation errors

### Link Check Results  
✅ Latest link check shows 0 broken links
✅ No duplicate URL patterns found (`/location/location`)
✅ All internal links generating correct format (`/location/service`)

### Manual Testing
✅ Development server running successfully
✅ No duplicate patterns found in generated HTML
✅ All components properly separating display text from URL slugs

## Files Modified
- `/app/[location]/[service]/page.tsx`
- `/components/contextual-links.tsx` 
- `/components/internal-links.tsx`
- `/components/schema-markup-location-minimal.tsx`
- `/components/schema-markup-location.tsx`

## Key Learning
The core issue was confusion between:
- **Slugs**: Used for URL generation (`location.slug`, `service.slug`)
- **Display names**: Used for user-facing text (`location.name`, `service.name`)

The fixes ensure proper separation and consistent usage throughout the application.

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
All duplicate URL patterns have been eliminated and the application is generating correct URLs.
