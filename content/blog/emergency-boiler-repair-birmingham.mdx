# Emergency Boiler Repair Services in Birmingham: What to Do When Your Boiler Breaks Down

When your boiler suddenly stops working, especially during the cold winter months, it can be a real emergency. Whether you're facing no heating, no hot water, or worse - a potential gas leak - knowing what to do and who to call can make all the difference.

## Immediate Steps to Take During a Boiler Emergency

### 1. Stay Calm and Assess the Situation

The first step is to remain calm and quickly assess what's happening with your boiler. Look for obvious signs like:

- Complete loss of heating and hot water
- Strange noises (banging, whistling, or gurgling)
- Unusual smells (especially gas odors)
- Visible leaks or damage
- Error codes on the display

### 2. Check Basic Settings

Before calling for emergency help, quickly check:

- **Thermostat settings** - Ensure it's set to the right temperature
- **Power supply** - Check if the boiler has power
- **Gas supply** - Verify the gas is turned on
- **Water pressure** - Look at the pressure gauge (should be 1-2 bar)

### 3. When to Call Emergency Services

Call for immediate emergency help if you notice:

- **Gas smell** - This is extremely dangerous
- **Carbon monoxide detector alarm**
- **Visible gas leak**
- **Water flooding from the boiler**
- **Electrical sparking or burning smells**

## Common Boiler Emergencies in Birmingham

### No Heating or Hot Water

This is the most common emergency call we receive, especially during Birmingham's cold winters. Possible causes include:

- Faulty thermostat
- Broken diverter valve
- Pump failure
- Boiler lockout due to fault

### Gas Leaks

Gas leaks are serious emergencies requiring immediate action:

1. **Turn off the gas supply** at the meter
2. **Open windows and doors** for ventilation
3. **Don't use electrical switches** or create sparks
4. **Evacuate the property** if smell is strong
5. **Call National Gas Emergency** on 0800 111 999
6. **Contact a Gas Safe engineer** for repairs

### Boiler Making Strange Noises

Unusual sounds often indicate serious problems:

- **Banging or kettling** - Usually scale buildup
